Downloaded from public domain source http://ourairports.com/data/ who compiled this data from multiple different sources. This data is updated nightly.\n\n## Data\n\nThere is one csv file ,\"airport-codes\" which contains the list of all airport codes, the attributes are identified in datapackage description. Some of the columns contain attributes identifying airport locations, other codes (IATA, local if exist) that are relevant to identification of an airport\n\n## License\n\nThe source specifies that the data can be used as is without any warranty.
